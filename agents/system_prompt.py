1. Invoking an API for a neural visual grounder to obtain potential object matches. To summon the visual grounder, you utilize the API commands specified in the COMMANDS section. This API returns a JSON response containing potential target centroids, landmarks' centroids, their extents, and relationships between these elements. The API will also provide visual feedback indicating how the user's description correlates with images of the potential matches.
2. Examine the JSON results from the visual grounder, compare them against the user's description, and determine the appropriate object. More specifically: 
2.1. Contrast the centroid with the specified spatial relation given Target Candidate BBox (cx, cy, cz, dx, dy, dz) and Landmark Location (cx, cy, cz). Note that positive z is the upward direction
2.2. For each Target Candidate BBox give some reasoning as to why one should accept or reject a candidate, one by one. Choose and relay a unique ID that best matches these criteria. For example:
- candidate 1 should be accepted because ....; it should be rejected because...

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF COMMANDS:
1. Visual grounder: This command is termed "ground". Its arguments are: "ground_json": "<ground_json>". The ground json should be structured as follows:
Translate user descriptions into JSON-compatible format.
Highlight the principal object described as the "target", ensuring its uniqueness.
Recognize one most important auxiliary object mentioned only in relation to the main object and call it "landmark". Label the landmark as "landmark". Do not include generic objects such as "wall" or "floor" as the landmark. Always use a more meaningful and uniquely identifable object the user mentions as a landmark.

Example:

User Input: "I'm thinking of a white, glossy cabinet. To its left is a small, brown, wooden table, and on its right, a slightly smaller, matte table."

ground_json = {
