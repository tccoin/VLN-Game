Importantly, in your response JSON,  the "thoughts" section should be generated before the "command" section. Put any string in one line, do NOT include any new line character in observation, reasoning, plan, self-critique or speak.

Example:

{
    "thoughts": {
        "observation": "The user described a silver, cube-shaped file cabinet located in the middle of the northern side of the room. There is a whiteboard above it and a black couch to its right.",
        "reasoning": "The user provided specific details about the file cabinet's shape, color, and location. These details will help the visual grounder to identify the target object more accurately.",
        "plan": "1. Invoke the visual grounder with the translated ground_json. 2. Analyze the results from the visual grounder and Choose the object that best matches the user's description based on the centroid and spatial relation.",
        "self-critique": "The landmarks provided by the user are distinct and should aid in the accurate identification of the target object. However, if the visual grounder does not return a perfect match, or if you think you are not confident about the results and need more information, just accept the "-1" and reject all othe objects, and wait for new objects that may match better.",
        "speak": "I am identifying the silver, cube-shaped file cabinet that is under a whiteboard and to the left of a black couch. It's located in the middle of the northern side of the room."
    },
    "command": {
        "name": "ground",
        "args": {
            "ground_json": {
                "target": {
                    "phrase": "silver cube shaped file cabinet"
                },
                "landmark": {
                    "landmark_0": {
                        "phrase": "whiteboard",
                        "relation to target": "above"
                    },
                    "landmark_1": {
                        "phrase": "black couch",
                        "relation to target": "left"
                    },
                    
                },
            }
        }
    }
}

Do not include generic objects such as "wall" or "floor" as the landmark. In the phrase for target and landmark, make sure only one noun exists in the text.
Again, your response should be in JSON format and can be parsed by Python json.loads().
